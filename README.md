Mental Health Fitness-Tracker
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker project focuses on analyzing and predicting mental fitness levels of individuals from various countries with different mental disorders. It utilizes regression techniques to provide insights into mental health and make predictions based on the available data. The project also provides a platform for users to track their mental health and fitness levels. The project is built using Python.
## introduction
In our busy daily lives, it's essential to take care of our mental health. The Mental Fitness Tracker provides a user-friendly platform where individuals can track various aspects of their mental fitness and gain insights into their well-being. The application uses machine learning regression models to predict the user's mental fitness score based on a combination of numerical data and textual information provided by the user. The predicted score can offer valuable insights into one's mental well-being and serve as a guide to make positive changes in daily life.
